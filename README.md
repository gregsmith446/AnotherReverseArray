# AnotherReverseArray
Data Structure Challenge

This ASP.NET console app written in C# takes as input:
int n = the size of the array
int[] arr = n space separated ints

The logic takes the input array and splits the numbers up
into individual ints, then joins the ints back together as a string,
where the string is reversed. 

The reversed input[] is then printed to the console in reverse, as a string.
